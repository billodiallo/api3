# BOOKS API

In this project, we're set up a simple Rails API-only-application. Rails API-only-applications are slimmed down compared to traditional Rails web applications.


## Built With

- Ruby v3.0.0
- Ruby on Rails v6.1.4
- RSpec-Rails for testing


## Current API Endpoints

The API will expose the following RESTful endpoints.
### BaseUrl: {Host-URL}/api/v1

|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| POST /register          | Signup                       |
| POST /login             | Login                        |
| GET /books              | Get all books                |
| GET /books/:id          | Get a bppl                   |
| POST /books             | Add a new book               |
| DELETE /books/:id       | Delete a book                |
| PUT /books/:id          | Update a book                |
| POST /categories        | Add category                 |
| GET /categories         | Get categories               |
